- **Instrumental variables**: Better instruments for lobbying
- **Regression discontinuity**: Exploit institutional thresholds

#### **2. Mechanism Analysis**
- **Information channels**: How does lobbying provide information?
- **Access mechanisms**: What drives lobbying effectiveness?
- **Policy outcomes**: Do questions translate to policy changes?

#### **3. Dynamic Effects**

- **Feedback loops**: Do policy changes affect future lobbying?

## Conclusion

The cross-topic analysis reveals significant heterogeneity in lobbying effectiveness across policy areas. Key findings include:

1. **Economics & Trade** shows the strongest lobbying responsiveness
2. **Environment & Climate** and **Foreign & Security Affairs** also show significant effects
3. **Technology** and **Education** show negative (though not significant) effects
4. **Agriculture** shows weak but significant effects with important heterogeneous patterns

These findings have important implications for:
- **Lobbying strategy**: Focus on high-responsiveness topics
- **Policy regulation**: Consider topic-specific transparency requirements
