# Empirical Literature Review: Lobbying Effects on Legislative Behavior

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive review of empirical literature on lobbying effects on legislative behavior, with particular focus on European Parliament (EP) and similar legislative contexts. The review covers methodological approaches, key findings, and implications for causal inference.

## Key Theoretical Frameworks

### 1. **Hall and Deardorff (2006): "Lobbying as Legislative Subsidy"**

**Core Theory:**
- Lobbying provides "legislative subsidies" to lawmakers
- Lobbyists supply information, expertise, and resources
- Effects are conditional on legislator preferences and institutional context

**Empirical Approach:**
- Panel data analysis with fixed effects
- Focus on lobbying expenditures and legislative activity
- Instrumental variables to address endogeneity

**Key Findings:**
- Lobbying has positive but modest effects on legislative activity
- Effects vary by legislator characteristics and policy area
- Information provision is the primary mechanism

**Methodological Contributions:**
- Established baseline fixed effects approach
- Emphasized importance of controlling for unobserved heterogeneity
- Highlighted need for instrumental variables in some contexts

### 2. **Baumgartner et al. (2009): "Lobbying and Policy Change"**

**Core Theory:**
- Lobbying effects depend on policy context and issue salience
- Non-linear effects: diminishing returns to lobbying
- Policy change requires multiple factors beyond lobbying

**Empirical Approach:**
- Large-scale survey of lobbyists and policymakers
- Multiple regression with interaction terms
- Robustness checks across different specifications

**Key Findings:**
- Lobbying effects are context-dependent
- Evidence of diminishing returns to lobbying intensity
- Policy change requires alignment of multiple factors

**Methodological Contributions:**
- Introduced non-linear specifications
- Emphasized importance of context and interactions
- Established framework for heterogeneous effects analysis

### 3. **Drutman (2015): "The Business of America is Lobbying"**

**Core Theory:**
- Business lobbying dominates policy influence
- Effects vary by industry and policy area
- Institutional context shapes lobbying effectiveness

**Empirical Approach:**
- Comprehensive analysis of lobbying expenditures
- Fixed effects models with industry controls
- Heterogeneous effects across different groups

**Key Findings:**
- Business lobbying has significant effects on policy outcomes

- Institutional rules mediate lobbying influence

**Methodological Contributions:**
- Established framework for heterogeneous treatment effects
- Emphasized importance of institutional context
- Introduced industry-level analysis

## Methodological Approaches in the Literature

### 1. **Fixed Effects Models (Most Common)**

**Specification:**
```
Y_it = α_i + γ_t + β*Lobbying_it + X_it'δ + ε_it
```

**Advantages:**
- Controls for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity
- Standard approach in panel data analysis
- Robust to many forms of endogeneity

**Limitations:**
- Assumes lobbying is exogenous conditional on fixed effects
- May not address reverse causality
- Requires sufficient within-unit variation

**Key Papers:**
- Hall and Deardorff (2006)
- Baumgartner et al. (2009)
- Multiple EP studies

### 2. **Instrumental Variables**

**Specification:**
```
First Stage: Lobbying_it = π_0 + π_1*Z_it + X_it'π_2 + ν_it
Second Stage: Y_it = α_i + γ_t + β*Lobbying_hat_it + X_it'δ + ε_it
```

**Advantages:**
- Addresses endogeneity directly
- Provides causal identification
- Robust to omitted variables

**Limitations:**
- Requires valid instrument
- May have weak instrument problems
- Complex implementation

**Key Papers:**
- Angrist and Pischke (2008)
- Multiple studies using institutional features as instruments

### 3. **Propensity Score Matching**

**Specification:**
```
Step 1: P(Treatment_i = 1) = f(X_i)
Step 2: Y_it = α_i + γ_t + β*Lobbying_it + X_it'δ + ε_it
```

**Advantages:**
- Addresses selection bias
- Creates comparable treatment and control groups
- Non-parametric approach

**Limitations:**
- Requires strong ignorability assumption
- May reduce sample size significantly
- Sensitive to matching algorithm

**Key Papers:**
- Imbens and Rubin (2015)
- Multiple applications in political science

### 4. **Dynamic Panel Models**

**Specification:**
```
Y_it = α_i + γ_t + ρ*Y_{i,t-1} + β*Lobbying_it + X_it'δ + ε_it
```

**Advantages:**
- Captures persistence in outcomes
- Distinguishes short-run and long-run effects
- Addresses some forms of endogeneity

**Limitations:**
- Requires longer time series
- May introduce bias with fixed effects
- Complex interpretation

**Key Papers:**
- Wooldridge (2010)
- Multiple applications in legislative studies

### 5. **Non-linear Models**

**Specification:**
```
Y_it = α_i + γ_t + β₁*Lobbying_it + β₂*Lobbying_it² + X_it'δ + ε_it
```

**Advantages:**
- Tests for diminishing returns
- Captures threshold effects
- More realistic functional form

**Limitations:**
- Increases model complexity
- May reduce statistical power
- Sensitive to functional form choice

**Key Papers:**
- Baumgartner et al. (2009)
- Multiple studies testing non-linear effects

## European Parliament Specific Literature

### 1. **MEP Behavior Studies**

**Key Findings:**
- MEPs respond to lobbying but effects are modest
- Effects vary by political group and committee membership
- National party influence mediates lobbying effects

**Methodological Approaches:**
- Panel data with MEP and time fixed effects
- Instrumental variables using institutional features
- Heterogeneous effects across political groups

### 2. **Committee Influence**

**Key Findings:**
- Committee membership amplifies lobbying effects
- Rapporteur positions are particularly responsive
- Policy expertise mediates lobbying influence

**Methodological Approaches:**

- Instrumental variables using committee assignment rules

### 3. **Political Group Effects**

## Conclusion

The empirical literature on lobbying effects provides a rich foundation for analyzing MEP behavior. Key insights include:

1. **Modest but significant effects** of lobbying on legislative behavior
2. **Heterogeneous effects** across different groups and contexts
3. **Importance of identification strategies** to address endogeneity
4. **Need for comprehensive robustness checks**
5. **Policy relevance** of understanding lobbying influence

The current analysis builds on this literature by implementing multiple identification strategies and testing for heterogeneous effects, providing a robust assessment of lobbying influence on MEP question-asking behavior.
